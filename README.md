## 📉 Baseline Results (Untuned LLaVA)

## 🔧 Fine-Tuning Approaches
- Multimodal Projector:
- Vision Transformer (ViT):
- Projector + ViT:
  
- Language Model Ablations
- Learning Rate Ablations: 

## 🔄 Generalization & Transfer Experiments

In this work, I have conducted experiments to see how the performance improvement in enumeration transfers. The following transfer scenarious were considered:

- Cross-category transfer
- Even → Odd numerosity transfer
- Cross Dataset Transfer (CCNL2 to CCNL1)
  
## 🧩 Representation Analysis
- Few-shot linear probing
- PCA embedding analysis

## 📐 Hyperparameter Analysis

## 🔁 Transfer to Downstream Numerical Tasks

## 📌 Key Improvements and Discussion

## ⚠️ Limitations and Future Work
